Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4**2 will give 16.
Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4.

# Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100 * (1.1**7))


VARIABLES AND TYPES:

Other variable types
In the previous exercise, you worked with two Python data types:

int, or integer: a number without a fractional part. savings, with the value 100, is an example of an integer.
float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. growth_multiplier, with the value 1.1, is an example of a float.
Next to numerical data types, there are two other very common data types:

str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be True or False (the capitalization is important!).


Guess the type
To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the type() function. Suppose you've defined a variable a, but you forgot the type of this variable. To determine the type of a, simply execute:

type(a)
We already went ahead and created three variables: a, b and c. You can use the IPython shell to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?


Operations with other types
Hugo mentioned that different types behave differently in Python.

When you sum two strings, for example, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans.

In the script some variables with different types have already been created. It's up to you to use them.


Type conversion
Using the + operator to paste together two strings can be very useful in building custom messages.

Suppose, for example, that you've calculated the return of your investment and want to summarize the results in a string. Assuming the integer savings and float result are defined, you can try something like this:

print("I started with $" + savings + " and now have $" + result + ". Awesome!")
This will not work, though, as you cannot simply sum strings and integers/floats.

To fix the error, you'll need to explicitly convert the types of your variables. More specifically, you'll need str(), to convert a value into a string. str(savings), for example, will convert the integer savings to a string.

Similar functions such as int(), float() and bool() will help you convert Python values into any type.


Create a list
As opposed to int, bool etc., a list is a compound data type; you can group values together:

a = "is"
b = "nice"
my_list = ["my", "list", a, b]
After measuring the height of your family, you decide to collect some information on the house you're living in. The areas of the different parts of your house are stored in separate variables for now, as shown in the script.

Create list with different types
A list can contain any Python type. Although it's not really common, a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, booleans, etc.

The printout of the previous exercise wasn't really satisfying. It's just a list of numbers representing the areas, but you can't tell which area corresponds to which part of your house.

The code in the editor is the start of a solution. For some of the areas, the name of the corresponding room is already placed in front. Pay attention here! "bathroom" is a string, while bath is a variable that represents the float 9.50 you specified earlier.


Select the valid list
A list can contain any Python type. But a list itself is also a Python type. That means that a list can also contain a list! Python is getting funkier by the minute, but fear not, just remember the list syntax:

my_list = [el1, el2, el3]


List of lists
As a data scientist, you'll often be dealing with a lot of data, and it will make sense to group some of this data.

Instead of creating a flat list containing strings and floats, representing the names and areas of the rooms in your house, you can create a list of lists. The script in the editor can already give you an idea.

Don't get confused here: "hallway" is a string, while hall is a variable that represents the float 11.25 you specified earlier.

Subset and conquer
Subsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list x and then selects "b" from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1. You can also use negative indexing.

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1]
x[-3] # same result!
Remember the areas list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?


Subset and calculate
After you've extracted values from a list, you can use them to perform additional calculations. Take this example, where the second and fourth element of a list x are extracted. The strings that result are pasted together using the + operator:

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
print(x[1] + x[3])


Slicing and dicing
Selecting single values from a list is just one part of the story. It's also possible to slice your list, which means selecting multiple elements from your list. Use the following syntax:

my_list[start:end]
The start index will be included, while the end index is not.

The code sample below shows an example. A list with "b" and "c", corresponding to indexes 1 and 2, are selected from a list x:

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1:3]
The elements with index 1 and 2 are included, while the element with index 3 is not.


Slicing and dicing (2)
In the video, Hugo first discussed the syntax where you specify both where to begin and end the slice of your list:

my_list[begin:end]
However, it's also possible not to specify these indexes. If you don't specify the begin index, Python figures out that you want to start your slice at the beginning of your list. If you don't specify the end index, the slice will go all the way to the last element of your list. To experiment with this, try the following commands in the IPython Shell:

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[:2]
x[2:]
x[:]


Subsetting lists of lists
You saw before that a Python list can contain practically anything; even other lists! To subset lists of lists, you can use the same technique as before: square brackets. Try out the commands in the following code sample in the IPython Shell:

x = [["a", "b", "c"],
     ["d", "e", "f"],
     ["g", "h", "i"]]
x[2][0]
x[2][:2]
x[2] results in a list, that you can subset again by adding additional square brackets.

What will house[-1][1] return? house, the list of lists that you created before, is already defined for you in the workspace. You can experiment with it in the IPython Shell.


Replace list elements
Replacing list elements is pretty easy. Simply subset the list and assign new values to the subset. You can select single elements or you can change entire list slices at once.

Use the IPython Shell to experiment with the commands below. Can you tell what's happening and why?

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[1] = "r"
x[2:] = ["s", "t"]
For this and the following exercises, you'll continue working on the areas list that contains the names and areas of different rooms in a house.


Extend a list
If you can change elements in a list, you sure want to be able to add elements to it, right? You can use the + operator:

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
y = x + ["e", "f"]
You just won the lottery, awesome! You decide to build a poolhouse and a garage. Can you add the information to the areas list?


Delete list elements
Finally, you can also remove elements from your list. You can do this with the del statement:

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
del(x[1])
Pay attention here: as soon as you remove an element from a list, the indexes of the elements that come after the deleted element all change!

The updated and extended version of areas that you've built in the previous exercises is coded below. You can copy and paste this into the IPython Shell to play around with the result.

areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0,
        "chill zone", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75,
         "bathroom", 10.50, "poolhouse", 24.5,
         "garage", 15.45]
There was a mistake! The amount you won with the lottery is not that big after all and it looks like the poolhouse isn't going to happen. You decide to remove the corresponding string and float from the areas list.

The ; sign is used to place commands on the same line. The following two code chunks are equivalent:

# Same line
command1; command2

# Separate lines
command1
command2

del(areas[-4:-3])


Inner workings of lists
At the end of the video, Hugo explained how Python lists work behind the scenes. In this exercise you'll get some hands-on experience with this.

The Python code in the script already creates a list with the name areas and a copy named areas_copy. Next, the first element in the areas_copy list is changed and the areas list is printed out. If you hit Run Code you'll see that, although you've changed areas_copy, the change also takes effect in the areas list. That's because areas and areas_copy point to the same list.

If you want to prevent changes in areas_copy from also taking effect in areas, you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the areas list. You can do this with list() or by using [:].

# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1 = areas + ["poolhouse", 24.5]

# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas_1 + ["garage", 15.45]
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Create areas_copy
areas_copy = areas

# Change areas_copy
areas_copy[0] = 5.0

# Print areas
print(areas)
[5.0, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.5]


# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Create areas_copy
areas_copy = list(areas)

# Change areas_copy
areas_copy[0] = 5.0

# Print areas
print(areas)

[11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.5]
